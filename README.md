# How to install
  
### `Installing packages:`
- First, clone the repository to your machine
- After cloning the repository, open the terminal inside the cloned repository directory and type:
```
  npm install
```  
- Or
```
  yarn install
```  
  
### `Optional:`
- The app uses the GitHub's api, by default the api has a maximum of 10 request per minute which is very low.
- You can change that number to 30 just by adding a `.env` file with your GitHub Personal Access Token.
- The name of the variable must be `VITE_github_token`
- Here is the example:
```env
  VITE_github_token="your_personal_token"
```
  
### `Run the app:`
- Now you gotta just run it...
```
  npm run dev
```
- Or
```
  yarn dev
```
